This is my first project that will demonstrate my ability to use html in a useful way. It will certainly not be pretty but it will give a good foundation to experiment with once I'll get some knowledge about CSS and JS.

Started styling my website using CSS, it does not look beautiful but it is some way to start.
Finished my work with CSS on this webpage, might come back to it later on and redo it.
