    <p>Moussaka is one of the best known Greek dishesâ€“ a baked casserole consisting of ground lamb meat</p> 
    <p>and layers of sliced eggplant, covered with a thick layer of bechamel sauce that gets golden and</p> 
    <p>crusty as it bakes. The lamb is sometimes replaced with beef, while the eggplants might be</p> 
    <p>replaced with zucchini or potatoes.</p>
