    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gyros is one of the most popular Greek street food dishes, consisting of meat such as pork and chicken</p>
    <p>(in Greece) or lamb and veal (popular in other countries) cooked on a vertical spit. The meat is sliced in</p> 
    <p>thin shavings and is then usually placed in a pita bread along with sauces such as tzatziki and</p> 
    <p>vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cucumbers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1/2 tbsp honey</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Tzatziki Sauce</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cucumber</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>60 ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>500g (1.1 lbs) yogurt</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To Serve</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pita breads</li>
            <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>fried potatoes (optional)</li>
            <li>lettuce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin with preparing the pork gyros: cut the tenderloin into thin strips and place them in a large bowl. Add garlic, onion, olive, oil, vinegar, and herbs and combine squeezing with your hands. To finish, add honey, cover the bowl, and place it into the fridge for at least 2 hours, and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, non-sticking pan. Toss in the pork with the entire marinade and sauté for 1 minute without stirring. Then, turn the ingredients on the other side and sauté for another minute, until the meat is browned and crispy on the outside, but still soft and juicy on the inside.</li>
        <li>Now, prepare the tzatziki sauce. Pulse olive oil and garlic in a food processor until the garlic is completely smooth and no chunks are left behind. Grate the cucumber, season with salt, and leave for 10 minutes. Now, drain the water out of the cucumber by wrapping it in a towel or a firm kitchen cloth and squeezing it with your hands. Mix cucumber, blended garlic, olive oil, yogurt, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and put in a refrigerator to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250°C/480°F. Brush both sides of pita breads with some oil and season them with salt, pepper, and oregano. Bake for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>To finish, spread some tzatziki on the pita bread, arrange the gyros on top, and add sliced tomato and onion. If you want to, you can also stuff some fried potatoes and lettuce in the pita bread. Wrap the pita bread like a sandwich and serve.</li>
    </ol>
