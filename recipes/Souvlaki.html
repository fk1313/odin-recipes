    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like Kabobs, the word Souvlaki simply means “meat on skewers.” But Greeks also use it to describe the actual meal—warm pita,</p>
    <p>loaded with perfectly marinated grilled meat and topped with Tzatziki sauce. Other fixings are typically included,</p>
    <p>and even a handful of fries are tucked into the pita.</p>
