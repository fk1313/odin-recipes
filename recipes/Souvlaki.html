    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like Kabobs, the word Souvlaki simply means “meat on skewers.” But Greeks also use it to describe the actual meal—warm pita,</p>
    <p>loaded with perfectly marinated grilled meat and topped with Tzatziki sauce. Other fixings are typically included,</p>
    <p>and even a handful of fries are tucked into the pita.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>For 6 servings</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg pork shoulder, boneless</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, grated</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt, heaping</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, heaping</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive (or canola) oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried Greek oregano, heaping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off any excess fat or membranes from the meat, then cut it into equal sized cubes.</li>
        <li>Toss the meat in a large bowl together with all the marinade ingredients, then refrigerate for a minimum of five hours (best overnight). Also, place the wooden skewers in a shallow container filled with water overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, take the meat out of the refrigerator and first wait until it comes to room temperature and then skewer it.</li>
        <li>Grill the souvlaki over medium-high heat, about 3-4 minutes per side. Keep warm until ready to serve. Sprinkle the grilled souvlaki with lemon juice, salt, and Greek oregano.</li>
        <li>Serve just with bread, or inside a pita with tzatziki sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
